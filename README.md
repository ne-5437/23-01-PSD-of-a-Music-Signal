# Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a Music Signal

## Description
This MATLAB project captures audio, visualizes it in the time domain, and computes its Power Spectral Density (PSD) to examine the frequency distribution of the signal.

## Features
- Records a 10-second audio signal.
- Plots the signal in the time domain.
- Computes and displays the PSD using Welch's method.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed.
- A working microphone for audio input.

## How It Works
1. Initializes an audio recorder.
2. Captures a 10-second audio signal.
3. Plots the time-domain waveform.
4. Computes and visualizes the PSD.
